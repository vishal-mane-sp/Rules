Hi Loga,

While working on the task  “Certification screen - Merge first three columns in one as UserName” I found that only CertificationEntityCustomization rule is not sufficient, it won’t populate the values in the required column along with that we need to following steps.

1)	Create a CertificationItem ObjectConfig object
2)	Add searchable extended attributes
3)	Generate database scripts
4)	UI Config changes
5)	Populate the certification item extended attribute

I found following document on SailPoint Community, could you please review and give your feedback on this?

Regards
Vishal
