Subject: Review Request: Approach for Merging Columns in Certification Screen
Hi Loga,
While working on the task “Certification screen - Merge the first three columns into one as UserName”, I noticed that the CertificationEntityCustomization rule alone is not sufficient to populate the values in the required column. In addition to the rule, we need to perform the following steps:
Create a CertificationItem ObjectConfig object
Add searchable extended attributes
Generate the necessary database scripts
Apply UI configuration changes
Populate the Certification Item extended attribute
I found a reference document on the SailPoint Community that outlines this approach. Could you please review and share your feedback?
Regards,
Vishal
